        <h2>Our Idea</h2>
        <p> The main and central objective of our work and social media was to provide a multi-faceted, diverse and versatile platform. Our main audience was socialites who needed a platform which could allow them to conduct all aspects of their life, from interaction with friends to networking and creating new connections. Our vision was motivated by an aspiration to create something that was bigger than ourselves. It is our true belief that a technology like this can make an impact so great that it will change the world.  </p>
